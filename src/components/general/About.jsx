        <h1>A Little Bit About Us</h1>
        <p>In North America millions of lost, stray, and abandoned animals enter shelters every year. With so many animals available, pet adoption is quickly becoming the most popular method of finding a new pet. </p>
        <p>Partnered with over 1,800 animal welfare organizations across the U.S. and Canada, Petango.com is the first adoptable pet search site to exclusively offer real-time updates of adoptable pets in shelters. So whether you’re looking to adopt a pet in New York or Texas, you can be sure to find a new pet near you. </p>
        <p>There are many reasons for a pet to become available for adoption, usually through no fault of their own. </p>
        <p>Many owners will give up their pets after realizing they can’t afford to keep them, they no longer want them, or sometimes just leave them behind after moving out of town. Although people often think that pets available in shelters are all mixed breeds, 25-30% of dogs up for adoption are actually purebred – and so are the cats! </p>
